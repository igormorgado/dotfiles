# Use the sequences from en_US.UTF-8 as the basis:
include "/usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose"

# This one should probably be deleted, because in
# en_US.UTF8 this is lowercase schwa, not uppercase:
<Multi_key> <e> <e> 			: "Ə" U018f

# Two nice additions -- maybe add to en_US.UTF8?
<Multi_key> <quotedbl> <backslash> 	: "〝" U301d	# REVERSED DOUBLE PRIME QUOTATION MARK
<Multi_key> <quotedbl> <slash>  	: "〞" U301e	# DOUBLE PRIME QUOTATION MARK

#  Overriding C with acute:
<dead_acute> <C> 			: "Ç" Ccedilla	# LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA
<dead_acute> <c> 			: "ç" ccedilla	# LATIN SMALL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA
